# D100 Dungeon by Martin Knight

## TO DO

### Mapping

- Room events - monsters, geographic, search, quest
- Doors
- Meta info
- Hero icon indicating current position - allow "teleporting"?
  - Should movement be arrow key based? - NO, move on click when adding a new tile. Bypasses wall collisions and keeps arrow keys for scrolling.
- What to do if map hits the boundaries of the grid?

### Combat
