# D100 Dungeon by Martin Knight

## TO DO

### Mapping

- Room events - monsters, geographic, search, quest
- Doors
- Meta info
- Hero icon indicating current position - allow "teleporting"?
  - Should movement be arrow key based?
- What to do if map hits the boundaries of the grid?
- Figure out why reset is broken (all secret passages all of a sudden)

### Combat
